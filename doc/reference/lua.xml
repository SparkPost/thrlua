    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para> Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities. It also offers good support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, light-weight scripting language for any program that needs one. Lua is implemented as a library, written in <emphasis>clean</emphasis> C (that is, in the common subset of ANSI C and C++). </para>
    <para> Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a &quot;main&quot; program: it only works <emphasis>embedded</emphasis> in a host client, called the <emphasis>embedding program</emphasis> or simply the <emphasis>host</emphasis>. This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework. The Lua distribution includes a sample host program called <literal>lua</literal>, which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter. </para>
    
    <para> Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places. For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers available at Lua&apos;s web site. For a detailed introduction to programming in Lua, see Roberto&apos;s book, <emphasis>Programming in Lua (Second Edition)</emphasis>. </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="language">
    <title>The Language</title>
    <para> This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua. In other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they can be combined, and what their combinations mean. </para>
    <para> The language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF notation, in which {<emphasis>a</emphasis>} means 0 or more <emphasis>a</emphasis>&apos;s, and [<emphasis>a</emphasis>] means an optional <emphasis>a</emphasis>. Non-terminals are shown like non-terminal, keywords are shown like <emphasis role="bold">kword</emphasis>, and other terminal symbols are shown like `<emphasis role="bold">=</emphasis>´. The complete syntax of Lua can be found in <link linkend="syntax">§8</link> at the end of this manual. </para>
    <sect1 id="lang.lex.conv">
      <title>Lexical Conventions</title>
      <para><emphasis>Names</emphasis> (also called <emphasis>identifiers</emphasis>) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit. This coincides with the definition of names in most languages. (The definition of letter depends on the current locale: any character considered alphabetic by the current locale can be used in an identifier.) Identifiers are used to name variables and table fields. </para>
      <para> The following <emphasis>keywords</emphasis> are reserved and cannot be used as names: </para>
      <screen>
     and       break     do        else      elseif
     end       false     for       function  if
     in        local     nil       not       or
     repeat    return    then      true      until     while
</screen>
      <para> Lua is a case-sensitive language: <literal>and</literal> is a reserved word, but <literal>And</literal> and <literal>AND</literal> are two different, valid names. As a convention, names starting with an underscore followed by uppercase letters (such as <link linkend="pdf-_VERSION"><literal>_VERSION</literal></link>) are reserved for internal global variables used by Lua. </para>
      <para> The following strings denote other tokens: </para>
      <screen>
     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
     ==    ~=    &lt;=    &gt;=    &lt;     &gt;     =
     (     )     {     }     [     ]
     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
</screen>
      <para><emphasis>Literal strings</emphasis> can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, and can contain the following C-like escape sequences: &apos;<literal>\a</literal>&apos; (bell), &apos;<literal>\b</literal>&apos; (backspace), &apos;<literal>\f</literal>&apos; (form feed), &apos;<literal>\n</literal>&apos; (newline), &apos;<literal>\r</literal>&apos; (carriage return), &apos;<literal>\t</literal>&apos; (horizontal tab), &apos;<literal>\v</literal>&apos; (vertical tab), &apos;<literal>\\</literal>&apos; (backslash), &apos;<literal>\&quot;</literal>&apos; (quotation mark [double quote]), and &apos;<literal>\&apos;</literal>&apos; (apostrophe [single quote]). Moreover, a backslash followed by a real newline results in a newline in the string. A character in a string can also be specified by its numerical value using the escape sequence <literal>\ddd</literal>, where <emphasis>ddd</emphasis> is a sequence of up to three decimal digits. (Note that if a numerical escape is to be followed by a digit, it must be expressed using exactly three digits.) Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros, which can be specified as &apos;<literal>\0</literal>&apos;. </para>
      <para> Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by <emphasis>long brackets</emphasis>. We define an <emphasis>opening long bracket of level <emphasis>n</emphasis></emphasis> as an opening square bracket followed by <emphasis>n</emphasis> equal signs followed by another opening square bracket. So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as <literal>[[</literal>, an opening long bracket of level 1 is written as <literal>[=[</literal>, and so on. A <emphasis>closing long bracket</emphasis> is defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written as <literal>]====]</literal>. A long string starts with an opening long bracket of any level and ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level. Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, and ignore long brackets of any other level. They can contain anything except a closing bracket of the proper level. </para>
      <para> For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a newline, the newline is not included in the string. As an example, in a system using ASCII (in which &apos;<literal>a</literal>&apos; is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and &apos;<literal>1</literal>&apos; is coded as 49), the five literal strings below denote the same string: </para>
      <screen>
     a = &apos;alo\n123&quot;&apos;
     a = &quot;alo\n123\&quot;&quot;
     a = &apos;\97lo\10\04923&quot;&apos;
     a = [[alo
     123&quot;]]
     a = [==[
     alo
     123&quot;]==]
</screen>
      <para> A <emphasis>numerical constant</emphasis> can be written with an optional decimal part and an optional decimal exponent. Lua also accepts integer hexadecimal constants, by prefixing them with <literal>0x</literal>. Examples of valid numerical constants are </para>
      <screen>
     3   3.0   3.1416   314.16e-2   0.31416E1   0xff   0x56
</screen>
      <para> A <emphasis>comment</emphasis> starts with a double hyphen (<literal>--</literal>) anywhere outside a string. If the text immediately after <literal>--</literal> is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a <emphasis>short comment</emphasis>, which runs until the end of the line. Otherwise, it is a <emphasis>long comment</emphasis>, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket. Long comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily. </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="lang.values.types">
      <title>Values and Types</title>
      <para> Lua is a <emphasis>dynamically typed language</emphasis>. This means that variables do not have types; only values do. There are no type definitions in the language. All values carry their own type. </para>
      <para> All values in Lua are <emphasis>first-class values</emphasis>. This means that all values can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results. </para>
      <para> There are eight basic types in Lua: <emphasis>nil</emphasis>, <emphasis>boolean</emphasis>, <emphasis>number</emphasis>, <emphasis>string</emphasis>, <emphasis>function</emphasis>, <emphasis>userdata</emphasis>, <emphasis>thread</emphasis>, and <emphasis>table</emphasis>. <emphasis>Nil</emphasis> is the type of the value <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>, whose main property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the absence of a useful value. <emphasis>Boolean</emphasis> is the type of the values <emphasis role="bold">false</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">true</emphasis>. Both <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">false</emphasis> make a condition false; any other value makes it true. <emphasis>Number</emphasis> represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers. (It is easy to build Lua interpreters that use other internal representations for numbers, such as single-precision float or long integers; see file <literal>luaconf.h</literal>.) <emphasis>String</emphasis> represents arrays of characters. Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any 8-bit character, including embedded zeros (&apos;<literal>\0</literal>&apos;) (see <link linkend="lang.lex.conv">§2.1</link>). </para>
      <para> Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written in C (see <link linkend="lang.expr.call">§2.5.8</link>). </para>
      <para> The type <emphasis>userdata</emphasis> is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua variables. This type corresponds to a block of raw memory and has no pre-defined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity test. However, by using <emphasis>metatables</emphasis>, the programmer can define operations for userdata values (see <link linkend="lang.metatable">§2.8</link>). Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Lua, only through the C API. This guarantees the integrity of data owned by the host program. </para>
      <para> The type <emphasis>thread</emphasis> represents independent threads of execution and it is used to implement coroutines (see <link linkend="lang.coro">§2.11</link>). Do not confuse Lua threads with operating-system threads. Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those that do not support threads. </para>
      <para> The type <emphasis>table</emphasis> implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be indexed not only with numbers, but with any value (except <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>). Tables can be <emphasis>heterogeneous</emphasis>; that is, they can contain values of all types (except <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>). Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc. To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index. The language supports this representation by providing <literal>a.name</literal> as syntactic sugar for <literal>a[&quot;name&quot;]</literal>. There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see <link linkend="lang.expr.ctor">§2.5.7</link>). </para>
      <para> Like indices, the value of a table field can be of any type (except <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>). In particular, because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain functions. Thus tables can also carry <emphasis>methods</emphasis> (see <link linkend="lang.expr.funcdef">§2.5.9</link>). </para>
      <para> Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are <emphasis>objects</emphasis>: variables do not actually <emphasis>contain</emphasis> these values, only <emphasis>references</emphasis> to them. Assignment, parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy. </para>
      <para> The library function <link linkend="pdf-type"><literal>type</literal></link> returns a string describing the type of a given value. </para>
      <sect2 id="lang.coercion">
        <title>Coercion</title>
        <para> Lua provides automatic conversion between string and number values at run time. Any arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert this string to a number, following the usual conversion rules. Conversely, whenever a number is used where a string is expected, the number is converted to a string, in a reasonable format. For complete control over how numbers are converted to strings, use the <literal>format</literal> function from the string library (see <link linkend="pdf-string.format"><literal>string.format</literal></link>). </para>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="lang.variables">
      <title>Variables</title>
      <para> Variables are places that store values. There are three kinds of variables in Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields. </para>
      <para> A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a function&apos;s formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable): </para>
      <screen>
	var ::= Name
</screen>
      <para> Name denotes identifiers, as defined in <link linkend="lang.lex.conv">§2.1</link>. </para>
      <para> Any variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a local (see <link linkend="lang.statements.local">§2.4.7</link>). Local variables are <emphasis>lexically scoped</emphasis>: local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope (see <link linkend="lang.scope">§2.6</link>). </para>
      <para> Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>. </para>
      <para> Square brackets are used to index a table: </para>
      <screen>
	var ::= prefixexp `<emphasis role="bold">[</emphasis>´ exp `<emphasis role="bold">]</emphasis>´
</screen>
      <para> The meaning of accesses to global variables and table fields can be changed via metatables. An access to an indexed variable <literal>t[i]</literal> is equivalent to a call <literal>gettable_event(t,i)</literal>. (See <link linkend="lang.metatable">§2.8</link> for a complete description of the <literal>gettable_event</literal> function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.) </para>
      <para> The syntax <literal>var.Name</literal> is just syntactic sugar for <literal>var[&quot;Name&quot;]</literal>: </para>
      <screen>
	var ::= prefixexp `<emphasis role="bold">.</emphasis>´ Name
</screen>
      <para> All global variables live as fields in ordinary Lua tables, called <emphasis>environment tables</emphasis> or simply <emphasis>environments</emphasis> (see <link linkend="lang.env">§2.9</link>). Each function has its own reference to an environment, so that all global variables in this function will refer to this environment table. When a function is created, it inherits the environment from the function that created it. To get the environment table of a Lua function, you call <link linkend="pdf-getfenv"><literal>getfenv</literal></link>. To replace it, you call <link linkend="pdf-setfenv"><literal>setfenv</literal></link>. (You can only manipulate the environment of C functions through the debug library; (see <link linkend="lib.debug">§5.9</link>).) </para>
      <para> An access to a global variable <literal>x</literal> is equivalent to <literal>_env.x</literal>, which in turn is equivalent to </para>
      <screen>
     gettable_event(_env, &quot;x&quot;)
</screen>
      <para> where <literal>_env</literal> is the environment of the running function. (See <link linkend="lang.metatable">§2.8</link> for a complete description of the <literal>gettable_event</literal> function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. Similarly, the <literal>_env</literal> variable is not defined in Lua. We use them here only for explanatory purposes.) </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="lang.statements">
      <title>Statements</title>
      <para> Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements, similar to those in Pascal or C. This set includes assignments, control structures, function calls, and variable declarations. </para>
      <sect2 id="lang.statements.chunks">
        <title>Chunks</title>
        <para> The unit of execution of Lua is called a <emphasis>chunk</emphasis>. A chunk is simply a sequence of statements, which are executed sequentially. Each statement can be optionally followed by a semicolon: </para>
        <screen>
	chunk ::= {stat [`<emphasis role="bold">;</emphasis>´]}
</screen>
        <para> There are no empty statements and thus &apos;<literal>;;</literal>&apos; is not legal. </para>
        <para> Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable number of arguments (see <link linkend="lang.expr.funcdef">§2.5.9</link>). As such, chunks can define local variables, receive arguments, and return values. </para>
        <para> A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program. To execute a chunk, Lua first pre-compiles the chunk into instructions for a virtual machine, and then it executes the compiled code with an interpreter for the virtual machine. </para>
        <para> Chunks can also be pre-compiled into binary form; see program <literal>luac</literal> for details. Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable; Lua automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly. </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="lang.statements.blocks">
        <title>Blocks</title>
        <para> A block is a list of statements; syntactically, a block is the same as a chunk: </para>
        <screen>
	block ::= chunk
</screen>
        <para> A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement: </para>
        <screen>
	stat ::= <emphasis role="bold">do</emphasis> block <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></screen>
        <para> Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations. Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> or <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis> statement in the middle of another block (see <link linkend="lang.statements.control">§2.4.4</link>). </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="lang.statements.assignment">
        <title>Assignment</title>
        <para> Lua allows multiple assignments. Therefore, the syntax for assignment defines a list of variables on the left side and a list of expressions on the right side. The elements in both lists are separated by commas: </para>
        <screen>
	stat ::= varlist `<emphasis role="bold">=</emphasis>´ explist
	varlist ::= var {`<emphasis role="bold">,</emphasis>´ var}
	explist ::= exp {`<emphasis role="bold">,</emphasis>´ exp}
</screen>
        <para> Expressions are discussed in <link linkend="lang.expr">§2.5</link>. </para>
        <para> Before the assignment, the list of values is <emphasis>adjusted</emphasis> to the length of the list of variables. If there are more values than needed, the excess values are thrown away. If there are fewer values than needed, the list is extended with as many <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>&apos;s as needed. If the list of expressions ends with a function call, then all values returned by that call enter the list of values, before the adjustment (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see <link linkend="lang.expr">§2.5</link>). </para>
        <para> The assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions and only then are the assignments performed. Thus the code </para>
        <screen>
     i = 3
     i, a[i] = i+1, 20
</screen>
        <para> sets <literal>a[3]</literal> to 20, without affecting <literal>a[4]</literal> because the <literal>i</literal> in <literal>a[i]</literal> is evaluated (to 3) before it is assigned 4. Similarly, the line </para>
        <screen>
     x, y = y, x
</screen>
        <para> exchanges the values of <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal>, and </para>
        <screen>
     x, y, z = y, z, x
</screen>
        <para> cyclically permutes the values of <literal>x</literal>, <literal>y</literal>, and <literal>z</literal>. </para>
        <para> The meaning of assignments to global variables and table fields can be changed via metatables. An assignment to an indexed variable <literal>t[i] = val</literal> is equivalent to <literal>settable_event(t,i,val)</literal>. (See <link linkend="lang.metatable">§2.8</link> for a complete description of the <literal>settable_event</literal> function. This function is not defined or callable in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.) </para>
        <para> An assignment to a global variable <literal>x = val</literal> is equivalent to the assignment <literal>_env.x = val</literal>, which in turn is equivalent to </para>
        <screen>
     settable_event(_env, &quot;x&quot;, val)
</screen>
        <para> where <literal>_env</literal> is the environment of the running function. (The <literal>_env</literal> variable is not defined in Lua. We use it here only for explanatory purposes.) </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="lang.statements.control">
        <title>Control Structures</title>
        <para> The control structures <emphasis role="bold">if</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">while</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="bold">repeat</emphasis> have the usual meaning and familiar syntax: </para>
        <screen>
	stat ::= <emphasis role="bold">while</emphasis> exp <emphasis role="bold">do</emphasis> block <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis>
	stat ::= <emphasis role="bold">repeat</emphasis> block <emphasis role="bold">until</emphasis> exp
	stat ::= <emphasis role="bold">if</emphasis> exp <emphasis role="bold">then</emphasis> block {<emphasis role="bold">elseif</emphasis> exp <emphasis role="bold">then</emphasis> block} [<emphasis role="bold">else</emphasis> block] <emphasis role="bold">end</emphasis></screen>
        <para> Lua also has a <emphasis role="bold">for</emphasis> statement, in two flavors (see <link linkend="lang.statements.for">§2.4.5</link>). </para>
        <para> The condition expression of a control structure can return any value. Both <emphasis role="bold">false</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> are considered false. All values different from <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">false</emphasis> are considered true (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also true). </para>
        <para> In the <emphasis role="bold">repeat</emphasis>–<emphasis role="bold">until</emphasis> loop, the inner block does not end at the <emphasis role="bold">until</emphasis> keyword, but only after the condition. So, the condition can refer to local variables declared inside the loop block. </para>
        <para> The <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> statement is used to return values from a function or a chunk (which is just a function). Functions and chunks can return more than one value, and so the syntax for the <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> statement is </para>
        <screen>
	stat ::= <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> [explist]
</screen>
        <para> The <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis> statement is used to terminate the execution of a <emphasis role="bold">while</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">repeat</emphasis>, or <emphasis role="bold">for</emphasis> loop, skipping to the next statement after the loop: </para>
        <screen>
	stat ::= <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis></screen>
        <para> A <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis> ends the innermost enclosing loop. </para>
        <para> The <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis> statements can only be written as the <emphasis>last</emphasis> statement of a block. If it is really necessary to <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> or <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis> in the middle of a block, then an explicit inner block can be used, as in the idioms <literal>do return end</literal> and <literal>do break end</literal>, because now <emphasis role="bold">return</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">break</emphasis> are the last statements in their (inner) blocks. </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2 id="lang.statements.for">
        <title>For Statement</title>
        <para> The <emphasis role="bold">for</emphasis> statement has two forms: one numeric and one generic. </para>
        <para> The numeric <emphasis role="bold">for</emphasis> loop repeats a block of code while a control variable runs through an arithmetic progression. It has the following syntax: </para>

Otherwise, Lua tries to call the &quot;lt&quot; or the &quot;le&quot; metamethod (see <link linkend="lang.metatable">§2.8</link>).

        <para> When a function is called, the list of arguments is adjusted to the length of the list of parameters, unless the function is a variadic or <emphasis>vararg function</emphasis>, which is indicated by three dots (&apos;<literal>...</literal>&apos;) at the end of its parameter list. A vararg function does not adjust its argument list; instead, it collects all extra arguments and supplies them to the function through a <emphasis>vararg expression</emphasis>, which is also written as three dots. The value of this expression is a list of all actual extra arguments, similar to a function with multiple results. If a vararg expression is used inside another expression or in the middle of a list of expressions, then its return list is adjusted to one element. If the expression is used as the last element of a list of expressions, then no adjustment is made (unless that last expression is enclosed in parentheses). </para>
        <para> As an example, consider the following definitions: </para>

      <title>Visibility Rules</title>
      <para> Lua is a lexically scoped language. The scope of variables begins at the first statement <emphasis>after</emphasis> their declaration and lasts until the end of the innermost block that includes the declaration. Consider the following example: </para>
      <screen>
     x = 10                -- global variable
     do                    -- new block
       local x = x         -- new &apos;x&apos;, with value 10
       print(x)            --&gt; 10
       x = x+1
       do                  -- another block
         local x = x+1     -- another &apos;x&apos;
         print(x)          --&gt; 12
       end
       print(x)            --&gt; 11
     end
     print(x)              --&gt; 10  (the global one)
</screen>
      <para> Notice that, in a declaration like <literal>local x = x</literal>, the new <literal>x</literal> being declared is not in scope yet, and so the second <literal>x</literal> refers to the outside variable. </para>
      <para> Because of the lexical scoping rules, local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope. A local variable used by an inner function is called an <emphasis>upvalue</emphasis>, or <emphasis>external local variable</emphasis>, inside the inner function. </para>
      <para> Notice that each execution of a <emphasis role="bold">local</emphasis> statement defines new local variables. Consider the following example: </para>
      <screen>
     a = {}
     local x = 20
     for i=1,10 do
       local y = 0
       a[i] = function () y=y+1; return x+y end
     end
</screen>
      <para> The loop creates ten closures (that is, ten instances of the anonymous function). Each of these closures uses a different <literal>y</literal> variable, while all of them share the same <literal>x</literal>. </para>

      <title>Error Handling</title>
      <para> Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library (see <link linkend="lua_pcall"><literal>lua_pcall</literal></link>). Whenever an error occurs during Lua compilation or execution, control returns to C, which can take appropriate measures (such as printing an error message). </para>
      <para> Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the <link linkend="pdf-error"><literal>error</literal></link> function. If you need to catch errors in Lua, you can use the <link linkend="pdf-pcall"><literal>pcall</literal></link> function. </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="lang.metatable">
      <title>Metatables</title>
      <para> Every value in Lua can have a <emphasis>metatable</emphasis>. This <emphasis>metatable</emphasis> is an ordinary Lua table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special operations. You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over a value by setting specific fields in its metatable. For instance, when a non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, Lua checks for a function in the field <literal>&quot;__add&quot;</literal> in its metatable. If it finds one, Lua calls this function to perform the addition. </para>
      <para> We call the keys in a metatable <emphasis>events</emphasis> and the values <emphasis>metamethods</emphasis>. In the previous example, the event is <literal>&quot;add&quot;</literal> and the metamethod is the function that performs the addition. </para>
      <para> You can query the metatable of any value through the <link linkend="pdf-getmetatable"><literal>getmetatable</literal></link> function. </para>
      <para> You can replace the metatable of tables through the <link linkend="pdf-setmetatable"><literal>setmetatable</literal></link> function. You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua (except by using the debug library); you must use the C API for that. </para>
      <para> Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables and userdata can share their metatables). Values of all other types share one single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all numbers, one for all strings, etc. </para>
      <para> A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, order comparisons, concatenation, length operation, and indexing. A metatable also can define a function to be called when a userdata is garbage collected. For each of these operations Lua associates a specific key called an <emphasis>event</emphasis>. When Lua performs one of these operations over a value, it checks whether this value has a metatable with the corresponding event. If so, the value associated with that key (the metamethod) controls how Lua will perform the operation. </para>
      <para> Metatables control the operations listed next. Each operation is identified by its corresponding name. The key for each operation is a string with its name prefixed by two underscores, &apos;<literal>__</literal>&apos;; for instance, the key for operation &quot;add&quot; is the string <literal>&quot;__add&quot;</literal>. The semantics of these operations is better explained by a Lua function describing how the interpreter executes the operation. </para>
      <para> The code shown here in Lua is only illustrative; the real behavior is hard coded in the interpreter and it is much more efficient than this simulation. All functions used in these descriptions (<link linkend="pdf-rawget"><literal>rawget</literal></link>, <link linkend="pdf-tonumber"><literal>tonumber</literal></link>, etc.) are described in <link linkend="lib.basic">§5.1</link>.

      <title>Garbage Collection</title>
      <para> Lua performs automatic memory management. This means that you have to worry neither about allocating memory for new objects nor about freeing it when the objects are no longer needed. Lua manages memory automatically by running a <emphasis>garbage collector</emphasis> from time to time to collect all <emphasis>dead objects</emphasis> (that is, objects that are no longer accessible from Lua). All memory used by Lua is subject to automatic management: tables, userdata, functions, threads, strings, etc. </para>
      <para> Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector. It uses two numbers to control its garbage-collection cycles: the <emphasis>garbage-collector pause</emphasis> and the <emphasis>garbage-collector step multiplier</emphasis>. Both use percentage points as units (so that a value of 100 means an internal value of 1). </para>
      <para> The garbage-collector pause controls how long the collector waits before starting a new cycle. Larger values make the collector less aggressive. Values smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle. A value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use to double before starting a new cycle. </para>
      <para> The step multiplier controls the relative speed of the collector relative to memory allocation. Larger values make the collector more aggressive but also increase the size of each incremental step. Values smaller than 100 make the collector too slow and can result in the collector never finishing a cycle. The default, 200, means that the collector runs at &quot;twice&quot; the speed of memory allocation. </para>
      <para> You can change these numbers by calling <link linkend="lua_gc"><literal>lua_gc</literal></link> in C or <link linkend="pdf-collectgarbage"><literal>collectgarbage</literal></link> in Lua. With these functions you can also control the collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it). </para>
      <sect2 id="lang.gc.metamethods">
        <title>Garbage-Collection Metamethods</title>
        <para> Using the C API, you can set garbage-collector metamethods for userdata (see <link linkend="lang.metatable">§2.8</link>). These metamethods are also called <emphasis>finalizers</emphasis>. Finalizers allow you to coordinate Lua&apos;s garbage collection with external resource management (such as closing files, network or database connections, or freeing your own memory). </para>
        <para> Garbage userdata with a field <literal>__gc</literal> in their metatables are not collected immediately by the garbage collector. Instead, Lua puts them in a list. After the collection, Lua does the equivalent of the following function for each userdata in that list: </para>
        <screen>
     function gc_event (udata)
       local h = metatable(udata).__gc
       if h then
         h(udata)
       end
     end
</screen>
        <para> At the end of each garbage-collection cycle, the finalizers for userdata are called in <emphasis>reverse</emphasis> order of their creation, among those collected in that cycle. That is, the first finalizer to be called is the one associated with the userdata created last in the program. The userdata itself is freed only in the next garbage-collection cycle. </para>

        <title>Weak Tables</title>
        <para> A <emphasis>weak table</emphasis> is a table whose elements are <emphasis>weak references</emphasis>. A weak reference is ignored by the garbage collector. In other words, if the only references to an object are weak references, then the garbage collector will collect this object. </para>
        <para> A weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both. A table with weak keys allows the collection of its keys, but prevents the collection of its values. A table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of both keys and values. In any case, if either the key or the value is collected, the whole pair is removed from the table. The weakness of a table is controlled by the <literal>__mode</literal> field of its metatable. If the <literal>__mode</literal> field is a string containing the character &apos;<literal>k</literal>&apos;, the keys in the table are weak. If <literal>__mode</literal> contains &apos;<literal>v</literal>&apos;, the values in the table are weak. </para>
        <para> After you use a table as a metatable, you should not change the value of its <literal>__mode</literal> field. Otherwise, the weak behavior of the tables controlled by this metatable is undefined. </para>

      <title>Coroutines</title>
      <para> Lua supports coroutines, also called <emphasis>collaborative multithreading</emphasis>. A coroutine in Lua represents an independent thread of execution. Unlike threads in multithread systems, however, a coroutine only suspends its execution by explicitly calling a yield function. </para>
      <para> You create a coroutine with a call to <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.create"><literal>coroutine.create</literal></link>. Its sole argument is a function that is the main function of the coroutine. The <literal>create</literal> function only creates a new coroutine and returns a handle to it (an object of type <emphasis>thread</emphasis>); it does not start the coroutine execution. </para>
      <para> When you first call <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link>, passing as its first argument a thread returned by <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.create"><literal>coroutine.create</literal></link>, the coroutine starts its execution, at the first line of its main function. Extra arguments passed to <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link> are passed on to the coroutine main function. After the coroutine starts running, it runs until it terminates or <emphasis>yields</emphasis>. </para>
      <para> A coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways: normally, when its main function returns (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction); and abnormally, if there is an unprotected error. In the first case, <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link> returns <emphasis role="bold">true</emphasis>, plus any values returned by the coroutine main function. In case of errors, <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link> returns <emphasis role="bold">false</emphasis> plus an error message. </para>
      <para> A coroutine yields by calling <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.yield"><literal>coroutine.yield</literal></link>. When a coroutine yields, the corresponding <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link> returns immediately, even if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main function, but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main function). In the case of a yield, <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link> also returns <emphasis role="bold">true</emphasis>, plus any values passed to <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.yield"><literal>coroutine.yield</literal></link>. The next time you resume the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it yielded, with the call to <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.yield"><literal>coroutine.yield</literal></link> returning any extra arguments passed to <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link>. </para>
      <para> Like <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.create"><literal>coroutine.create</literal></link>, the <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.wrap"><literal>coroutine.wrap</literal></link> function also creates a coroutine, but instead of returning the coroutine itself, it returns a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine. Any arguments passed to this function go as extra arguments to <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link>. <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.wrap"><literal>coroutine.wrap</literal></link> returns all the values returned by <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link>, except the first one (the boolean error code). Unlike <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.resume"><literal>coroutine.resume</literal></link>, <link linkend="pdf-coroutine.wrap"><literal>coroutine.wrap</literal></link> does not catch errors; any error is propagated to the caller. </para>
      <para> As an example, consider the following code: </para>
      <screen>
     function foo (a)
       print(&quot;foo&quot;, a)
       return coroutine.yield(2*a)
     end

           print(&quot;co-body&quot;, a, b)

           local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)
           print(&quot;co-body&quot;, r, s)
           return b, &quot;end&quot;

    <title>The Application Program Interface</title>
    <para> This section describes the C API for Lua, that is, the set of C functions available to the host program to communicate with Lua. All API functions and related types and constants are declared in the header file <anchor xml:id="pdf-lua.h" xreflabel="lua.h"/><literal>lua.h</literal>. </para>
    <para> Even when we use the term &quot;function&quot;, any facility in the API may be provided as a macro instead. All such macros use each of their arguments exactly once (except for the first argument, which is always a Lua state), and so do not generate any hidden side-effects. </para>
    <para> As in most C libraries, the Lua API functions do not check their arguments for validity or consistency. However, you can change this behavior by compiling Lua with a proper definition for the macro <anchor xml:id="pdf-luai_apicheck" xreflabel="luai_apicheck"/><literal>luai_apicheck</literal>, in file <literal>luaconf.h</literal>. </para>
    <sect1 id="api.stack">
      <title>The Stack</title>
      <para> Lua uses a <emphasis>virtual stack</emphasis> to pass values to and from C. Each element in this stack represents a Lua value (<emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>, number, string, etc.). </para>
      <para> Whenever Lua calls C, the called function gets a new stack, which is independent of previous stacks and of stacks of C functions that are still active. This stack initially contains any arguments to the C function and it is where the C function pushes its results to be returned to the caller (see <link linkend="lua_CFunction"><literal>lua_CFunction</literal></link>). </para>
      <para> For convenience, most query operations in the API do not follow a strict stack discipline. Instead, they can refer to any element in the stack by using an <emphasis>index</emphasis>: A positive index represents an <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> stack position (starting at 1); a negative index represents an <emphasis>offset</emphasis> relative to the top of the stack. More specifically, if the stack has <emphasis>n</emphasis> elements, then index 1 represents the first element (that is, the element that was pushed onto the stack first) and index <emphasis>n</emphasis> represents the last element; index -1 also represents the last element (that is, the element at the top) and index <emphasis>-n</emphasis> represents the first element. We say that an index is <emphasis>valid</emphasis> if it lies between 1 and the stack top (that is, if <literal>1 ≤ abs(index) ≤ top</literal>). </para>

To return values to Lua, a C function just pushes them onto the stack, in direct order (the first result is pushed first), and returns the number of results. Any other value in the stack below the results will be properly discarded by Lua. Like a Lua function, a C function called by Lua can also return many results. </para>
        <para> As an example, the following function receives a variable number of numerical arguments and returns their average and sum: </para>
        <screen>
     static int foo (lua_State *L) {
       int n = lua_gettop(L);    /* number of arguments */
       lua_Number sum = 0;
       int i;
       for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
         if (!lua_isnumber(L, i)) {
           lua_pushstring(L, &quot;incorrect argument&quot;);
           lua_error(L);
         }
         sum += lua_tonumber(L, i);
       }
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum/n);        /* first result */
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum);         /* second result */
       return 2;                   /* number of results */

        <para> Starts and resumes a coroutine in a given thread. </para>
        <para> To start a coroutine, you first create a new thread (see <link linkend="lua_newthread"><literal>lua_newthread</literal></link>); then you push onto its stack the main function plus any arguments; then you call <link linkend="lua_resume"><literal>lua_resume</literal></link>, with <literal>narg</literal> being the number of arguments. This call returns when the coroutine suspends or finishes its execution. When it returns, the stack contains all values passed to <link linkend="lua_yield"><literal>lua_yield</literal></link>, or all values returned by the body function. <link linkend="lua_resume"><literal>lua_resume</literal></link> returns <link linkend="pdf-LUA_YIELD"><literal>LUA_YIELD</literal></link> if the coroutine yields, 0 if the coroutine finishes its execution without errors, or an error code in case of errors (see <link linkend="lua_pcall"><literal>lua_pcall</literal></link>). In case of errors, the stack is not unwound, so you can use the debug API over it. The error message is on the top of the stack. To restart a coroutine, you put on its stack only the values to be passed as results from <literal>yield</literal>, and then call <link linkend="lua_resume"><literal>lua_resume</literal></link>. </para>

    <para> All functions in the auxiliary library are built on top of the basic API, and so they provide nothing that cannot be done with this API. </para>
    <para> Several functions in the auxiliary library are used to check C function arguments. Their names are always <literal>luaL_check*</literal> or <literal>luaL_opt*</literal>.

    <title>Standard Libraries</title>
    <para> The standard Lua libraries provide useful functions that are implemented directly through the C API. Some of these functions provide essential services to the language (e.g., <link linkend="pdf-type"><literal>type</literal></link> and <link linkend="pdf-getmetatable"><literal>getmetatable</literal></link>); others provide access to &quot;outside&quot; services (e.g., I/O); and others could be implemented in Lua itself, but are quite useful or have critical performance requirements that deserve an implementation in C (e.g., <link linkend="pdf-table.sort"><literal>table.sort</literal></link>). </para>
    <para> All libraries are implemented through the official C API and are provided as separate C modules. Currently, Lua has the following standard libraries: </para>

</itemizedlist>
    <para> Except for the basic and package libraries, each library provides all its functions as fields of a global table or as methods of its objects. </para>
    <para> To have access to these libraries, the C host program should call the <link linkend="luaL_openlibs"><literal>luaL_openlibs</literal></link> function, which opens all standard libraries. Alternatively, it can open them individually by calling <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_base" xreflabel="luaopen_base"/><literal>luaopen_base</literal> (for the basic library), <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_package" xreflabel="luaopen_package"/><literal>luaopen_package</literal> (for the package library), <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_string" xreflabel="luaopen_string"/><literal>luaopen_string</literal> (for the string library), <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_table" xreflabel="luaopen_table"/><literal>luaopen_table</literal> (for the table library), <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_math" xreflabel="luaopen_math"/><literal>luaopen_math</literal> (for the mathematical library), <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_io" xreflabel="luaopen_io"/><literal>luaopen_io</literal> (for the I/O library), <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_os" xreflabel="luaopen_os"/><literal>luaopen_os</literal> (for the Operating System library), and <anchor xml:id="pdf-luaopen_debug" xreflabel="luaopen_debug"/><literal>luaopen_debug</literal> (for the debug library). These functions are declared in <anchor xml:id="pdf-lualib.h" xreflabel="lualib.h"/><literal>lualib.h</literal> and should not be called directly: you must call them like any other Lua C function, e.g., by using <link linkend="lua_call"><literal>lua_call</literal></link>. </para>

        <para> Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk.

A return of an empty string, <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>, or no value signals the end of the chunk. </para>
        <para> If there are no errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function; otherwise, returns <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> plus the error message. The environment of the returned function is the global environment. </para>

        <para> Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table. Its first argument is a table and its second argument is an index in this table. <literal>next</literal> returns the next index of the table and its associated value. When called with <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> as its second argument, <literal>next</literal> returns an initial index and its associated value. When called with the last index, or with <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> in an empty table, <literal>next</literal> returns <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>. If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>. In particular, you can use <literal>next(t)</literal> to check whether a table is empty. </para>
        <para> The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, <emphasis>even for numeric indices</emphasis>.

        <para> Calls function <literal>f</literal> with the given arguments in <emphasis>protected mode</emphasis>. This means that any error inside <literal>f</literal> is not propagated; instead, <literal>pcall</literal> catches the error and returns a status code. Its first result is the status code (a boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without errors. In such case, <literal>pcall</literal> also returns all results from the call, after this first result.

        <para> Sets the environment to be used by the given function. <literal>f</literal> can be a Lua function or a number that specifies the function at that stack level: Level 1 is the function calling <literal>setfenv</literal>. <literal>setfenv</literal> returns the given function. </para>
        <para> As a special case, when <literal>f</literal> is 0 <literal>setfenv</literal> changes the environment of the running thread. In this case, <literal>setfenv</literal> returns no values. </para>

        <para> An optional argument specifies the base to interpret the numeral. The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above 10, the letter &apos;<literal>A</literal>&apos; (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, &apos;<literal>B</literal>&apos; represents 11, and so forth, with &apos;<literal>Z</literal>&apos; representing 35. In base 10 (the default), the number can have a decimal part, as well as an optional exponent part (see <link linkend="lang.lex.conv">§2.1</link>).

      <title>Modules</title>
      <para> The package library provides basic facilities for loading and building modules in Lua. It exports two of its functions directly in the global environment: <link linkend="pdf-require"><literal>require</literal></link> and <link linkend="pdf-module"><literal>module</literal></link>. Everything else is exported in a table <anchor xml:id="pdf-package" xreflabel="package"/><literal>package</literal>. </para>
      <sect2>
        <title><anchor xml:id="pdf-module" xreflabel="module (name [, ···])"/><literal>module (name [, ···])</literal></title>
        <para> Creates a module. If there is a table in <literal>package.loaded[name]</literal>, this table is the module. Otherwise, if there is a global table <literal>t</literal> with the given name, this table is the module. Otherwise creates a new table <literal>t</literal> and sets it as the value of the global <literal>name</literal> and the value of <literal>package.loaded[name]</literal>. This function also initializes <literal>t._NAME</literal> with the given name, <literal>t._M</literal> with the module (<literal>t</literal> itself), and <literal>t._PACKAGE</literal> with the package name (the full module name minus last component; see below). Finally, <literal>module</literal> sets <literal>t</literal> as the new environment of the current function and the new value of <literal>package.loaded[name]</literal>, so that <link linkend="pdf-require"><literal>require</literal></link> returns <literal>t</literal>. </para>
        <para> If <literal>name</literal> is a compound name (that is, one with components separated by dots), <literal>module</literal> creates (or reuses, if they already exist) tables for each component. For instance, if <literal>name</literal> is <literal>a.b.c</literal>, then <literal>module</literal> stores the module table in field <literal>c</literal> of field <literal>b</literal> of global <literal>a</literal>. </para>

        <title><anchor xml:id="pdf-require" xreflabel="require (modname)"/><literal>require (modname)</literal></title>
        <para> Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the <link linkend="pdf-package.loaded"><literal>package.loaded</literal></link> table to determine whether <literal>modname</literal> is already loaded. If it is, then <literal>require</literal> returns the value stored at <literal>package.loaded[modname]</literal>. Otherwise, it tries to find a <emphasis>loader</emphasis> for the module. </para>
        <para> To find a loader, <literal>require</literal> is guided by the <link linkend="pdf-package.loaders"><literal>package.loaders</literal></link> array. By changing this array, we can change how <literal>require</literal> looks for a module. The following explanation is based on the default configuration for <link linkend="pdf-package.loaders"><literal>package.loaders</literal></link>. </para>
        <para> First <literal>require</literal> queries <literal>package.preload[modname]</literal>. If it has a value, this value (which should be a function) is the loader. Otherwise <literal>require</literal> searches for a Lua loader using the path stored in <link linkend="pdf-package.path"><literal>package.path</literal></link>. If that also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in <link linkend="pdf-package.cpath"><literal>package.cpath</literal></link>. If that also fails, it tries an <emphasis>all-in-one</emphasis> loader (see <link linkend="pdf-package.loaders"><literal>package.loaders</literal></link>). </para>
        <para> Once a loader is found, <literal>require</literal> calls the loader with a single argument, <literal>modname</literal>. If the loader returns any value, <literal>require</literal> assigns the returned value to <literal>package.loaded[modname]</literal>. If the loader returns no value and has not assigned any value to <literal>package.loaded[modname]</literal>, then <literal>require</literal> assigns <emphasis role="bold">true</emphasis> to this entry. In any case, <literal>require</literal> returns the final value of <literal>package.loaded[modname]</literal>. </para>
        <para> If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any loader for the module, then <literal>require</literal> signals an error. </para>

        <para> Each entry in this table is a <emphasis>searcher function</emphasis>. When looking for a module, <link linkend="pdf-require"><literal>require</literal></link> calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the module name (the argument given to <link linkend="pdf-require"><literal>require</literal></link>) as its sole parameter. The function can return another function (the module <emphasis>loader</emphasis>) or a string explaining why it did not find that module (or <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis> if it has nothing to say). Lua initializes this table with four functions. </para>
        <para> The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the <link linkend="pdf-package.preload"><literal>package.preload</literal></link> table. </para>
        <para> The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored at <link linkend="pdf-package.path"><literal>package.path</literal></link>. A path is a sequence of <emphasis>templates</emphasis> separated by semicolons. For each template, the searcher will change each interrogation mark in the template by <literal>filename</literal>, which is the module name with each dot replaced by a &quot;directory separator&quot; (such as &quot;<literal>/</literal>&quot; in Unix); then it will try to open the resulting file name. So, for instance, if the Lua path is the string </para>
        <screen>
     &quot;./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua&quot;
</screen>
        <para> the search for a Lua file for module <literal>foo</literal> will try to open the files <literal>./foo.lua</literal>, <literal>./foo.lc</literal>, and <literal>/usr/local/foo/init.lua</literal>, in that order. </para>
        <para> The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable <link linkend="pdf-package.cpath"><literal>package.cpath</literal></link>. For instance, if the C path is the string </para>
        <screen>
     &quot;./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so&quot;
</screen>
        <para> the searcher for module <literal>foo</literal> will try to open the files <literal>./foo.so</literal>, <literal>./foo.dll</literal>, and <literal>/usr/local/foo/init.so</literal>, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string &quot;<literal>luaopen_</literal>&quot; concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is <literal>a.v1-b.c</literal>, the function name will be <literal>luaopen_b_c</literal>. </para>
        <para> The fourth searcher tries an <emphasis>all-in-one loader</emphasis>. It searches the C path for a library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring <literal>a.b.c</literal>, it will search for a C library for <literal>a</literal>. If found, it looks into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example, that would be <literal>luaopen_a_b_c</literal>. With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its original open function. </para>

        <para> This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module system.

      <title>String Manipulation</title>
      <para> This library provides generic functions for string manipulation, such as finding and extracting substrings, and pattern matching. When indexing a string in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not at 0, as in C). Indices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing backwards, from the end of the string. Thus, the last character is at position -1, and so on. </para>
      <para> The string library provides all its functions inside the table <anchor xml:id="pdf-string" xreflabel="string"/><literal>string</literal>. It also sets a metatable for strings where the <literal>__index</literal> field points to the <literal>string</literal> table. Therefore, you can use the string functions in object-oriented style.

The sequence <literal>%0</literal> stands for the whole match. The sequence <literal>%%</literal> stands for a single <literal>%</literal>. </para>
        <para> If <literal>repl</literal> is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first capture as the key; if the pattern specifies no captures, then the whole match is used as the key. </para>

        <para> If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is <emphasis role="bold">false</emphasis> or <emphasis role="bold">nil</emphasis>, then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is kept in the string). </para>

          <para> A <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> is a sequence of pattern items.

A &apos;<literal>$</literal>&apos; at the end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of the subject string.

          <title>Captures:</title>
          <para> A pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they describe <emphasis>captures</emphasis>. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string that match captures are stored (<emphasis>captured</emphasis>) for future use. Captures are numbered according to their left parentheses. For instance, in the pattern <literal>&quot;(a*(.)%w(%s*))&quot;</literal>, the part of the string matching <literal>&quot;a*(.)%w(%s*)&quot;</literal> is stored as the first capture (and therefore has number 1); the character matching &quot;<literal>.</literal>&quot; is captured with number 2, and the part matching &quot;<literal>%s*</literal>&quot; has number 3. </para>
          <para> As a special case, the empty capture <literal>()</literal> captures the current string position (a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern <literal>&quot;()aa()&quot;</literal> on the string <literal>&quot;flaaap&quot;</literal>, there will be two captures: 3 and 5. </para>
          <para> A pattern cannot contain embedded zeros. Use <literal>%z</literal> instead. </para>

      <para> The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The first one uses implicit file descriptors; that is, there are operations to set a default input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations are over these default files. The second style uses explicit file descriptors. </para>
      <para> When using implicit file descriptors, all operations are supplied by table <anchor xml:id="pdf-io" xreflabel="io"/><literal>io</literal>. When using explicit file descriptors, the operation <link linkend="pdf-io.open"><literal>io.open</literal></link> returns a file descriptor and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file descriptor. </para>

        <para> For instance, the expression <literal>debug.getinfo(1,&quot;n&quot;).name</literal> returns a table with a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found, and the expression <literal>debug.getinfo(print)</literal> returns a table with all available information about the <link linkend="pdf-print"><literal>print</literal></link> function. </para>

    <title>Lua Stand-alone</title>
    <para> Although Lua has been designed as an extension language, to be embedded in a host C program, it is also frequently used as a stand-alone language. An interpreter for Lua as a stand-alone language, called simply <literal>lua</literal>, is provided with the standard distribution. The stand-alone interpreter includes all standard libraries, including the debug library. Its usage is: </para>

      </listitem>

      </listitem>
<listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold"><literal>-i</literal>:</emphasis>  enters interactive mode after running <emphasis>script</emphasis>;</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold"><literal>-</literal>:</emphasis>  executes <literal>stdin</literal> as a file and stops handling options.</para>
      </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
    <para> After handling its options, <literal>lua</literal> runs the given <emphasis>script</emphasis>, passing to it the given <emphasis>args</emphasis> as string arguments. When called without arguments, <literal>lua</literal> behaves as <literal>lua -v -i</literal> when the standard input (<literal>stdin</literal>) is a terminal, and as <literal>lua -</literal> otherwise. </para>
    <para> Before running any argument, the interpreter checks for an environment variable <anchor xml:id="pdf-LUA_INIT" xreflabel="LUA_INIT"/><literal>LUA_INIT</literal>. If its format is <literal>@filename</literal>, then <literal>lua</literal> executes the file. Otherwise, <literal>lua</literal> executes the string itself. </para>
    <para> All options are handled in order, except <literal>-i</literal>. For instance, an invocation like </para>
    <screen>
     $ lua -e&apos;a=1&apos; -e &apos;print(a)&apos; script.lua
</screen>
    <para> will first set <literal>a</literal> to 1, then print the value of <literal>a</literal> (which is &apos;<literal>1</literal>&apos;), and finally run the file <literal>script.lua</literal> with no arguments. (Here <literal>$</literal> is the shell prompt. Your prompt may be different.) </para>
    <para> Before starting to run the script, <literal>lua</literal> collects all arguments in the command line in a global table called <literal>arg</literal>. The script name is stored at index 0, the first argument after the script name goes to index 1, and so on. Any arguments before the script name (that is, the interpreter name plus the options) go to negative indices. For instance, in the call </para>
    <screen>
     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2
</screen>
    <para> the interpreter first runs the file <literal>a.lua</literal>, then creates a table </para>
    <screen>
     arg = { [-2] = &quot;lua&quot;, [-1] = &quot;-la&quot;,
             [0] = &quot;b.lua&quot;,
             [1] = &quot;t1&quot;, [2] = &quot;t2&quot; }
</screen>
    <para> and finally runs the file <literal>b.lua</literal>. The script is called with <literal>arg[1]</literal>, <literal>arg[2]</literal>, ··· as arguments; it can also access these arguments with the vararg expression &apos;<literal>...</literal>&apos;. </para>
    <para> In interactive mode, if you write an incomplete statement, the interpreter waits for its completion by issuing a different prompt. </para>
    <para> If the global variable <anchor xml:id="pdf-_PROMPT" xreflabel="_PROMPT"/><literal>_PROMPT</literal> contains a string, then its value is used as the prompt. Similarly, if the global variable <anchor xml:id="pdf-_PROMPT2" xreflabel="_PROMPT2"/><literal>_PROMPT2</literal> contains a string, its value is used as the secondary prompt (issued during incomplete statements). Therefore, both prompts can be changed directly on the command line or in any Lua programs by assigning to <literal>_PROMPT</literal>. See the next example: </para>
    <screen>
     $ lua -e&quot;_PROMPT=&apos;myprompt&gt; &apos;&quot; -i
</screen>
    <para> (The outer pair of quotes is for the shell, the inner pair is for Lua.) Note the use of <literal>-i</literal> to enter interactive mode; otherwise, the program would just end silently right after the assignment to <literal>_PROMPT</literal>. </para>
    <para> To allow the use of Lua as a script interpreter in Unix systems, the stand-alone interpreter skips the first line of a chunk if it starts with <literal>#</literal>. Therefore, Lua scripts can be made into executable programs by using <literal>chmod +x</literal> and the <literal>#!</literal> form, as in </para>
    <screen>
     #!/usr/local/bin/lua
</screen>
